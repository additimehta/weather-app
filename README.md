The idea of the weatherapp is to use the Weather Channel's website by extracting certain data and putting them on to the app. 
I used BeautifulSoup4 to extract the location, tempearture and the weather prediction from the HTML file of the website.
By using requests I accessed the website so I can extract details
To make sure that my app is up to date at, every 60 seconds the app refreshes to update the location, temperature and weather predictioon
